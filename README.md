## Initial Motivation
* I found that it was competitive to book meeting rooms at my current workplace. There were so many meetings to hold but not enough physical meeting rooms were available. 
* You would walk around the office to check if there is any meeting rooms available and write down your name and time to occupy the room in that time. 
* I thought this process is too manual and decided to build a web application to do this online.
